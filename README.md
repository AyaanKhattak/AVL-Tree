# AVL-Tree
AVL Tree Implementation in C++
This project provides a comprehensive implementation of an AVL Tree in C++. An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. This implementation includes core functionalities such as:

Insertion: Automatically balances the tree after inserting a new node to maintain the AVL property.
Deletion: Removes nodes from the tree while ensuring the tree remains balanced.
Search: Efficiently searches for elements within the tree.
Traversal: Supports inorder, preorder, and postorder tree traversals.
Successor & Predecessor Operations: Finds the successor and predecessor of a given node.
Height and Diameter Calculation: Computes the height and diameter of the tree.
Balance Factor Calculation: Determines the balance factor for nodes to maintain AVL properties.
The src.cpp file demonstrates the usage of the AVL tree with various operations, making it a useful resource for understanding how the tree works in practice.

This project is ideal for those interested in data structures, algorithms, and specifically, tree-based structures in computer science.
